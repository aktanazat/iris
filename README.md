A camera for coding agents. Capture pages, compare saved images, and inspect capture readiness without adding a model call.

## Install

```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brijr/iris/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or with a Rust toolchain:

```
cargo install iris-screenshot
```

The crates.io package is named `iris-screenshot`; the installed command is `iris`.

The only runtime dependency is an installed Chrome-family browser (Chrome, Chromium, Edge, or Brave).
Building from source requires Rust 1.88 or newer.

## Give your coding agent eyes

Iris includes a local stdio MCP server in the same binary. Add it to Codex:

```
codex mcp add iris -- iris mcp
```

Or use the equivalent configuration in another MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iris": {
      "command": "iris",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server exposes three tools:

- `capture` returns one image inline with structured metadata. It writes nothing unless `output` is supplied.
- `capture_batch` accepts a `captures` array of 1–16 capture requests. Up to four run concurrently. Results stay in input order; a failed item does not discard successful images.
- `compare` compares two saved PNG, JPEG, or WebP files. It returns changed-pixel counts and bounds, and can write a PNG difference image with `output`.

All three run locally. They do not send images, page contents, or reports to an AI service.

```json
{
  "url": "localhost:3000",
  "selector": "#pricing-card",
  "padding": 24,
  "size": "desktop",
  "dark": false,
  "format": "png",
  "timeout_seconds": 30,
  "output": "/tmp/pricing-card.png"
}
```

Bare localhost, `.localhost`, and loopback addresses use HTTP automatically. Other bare hosts use HTTPS. Run `iris mcp --help` to select a Chrome binary for the server.

MCP clients may need to restart the server and refresh tool discovery before new tools or parameters appear.

## Setup Prompt

Give this setup prompt to your coding agent:

```text
Set up Iris as your visual camera in this coding environment.

Goal: install Iris, connect its local MCP server to this agent client, and prove
both the CLI and MCP paths work. Do not modify the application repository.

1. Check for an installed Chrome-family browser, `iris --version`, and an
   existing Iris MCP configuration.
2. If Iris is missing or outdated, install it with:

   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brijr/iris/main/install.sh | sh

   Or, when Rust is available:

   cargo install iris-screenshot

   Make sure the resulting `iris` command is on PATH.
3. Register the stdio MCP server without duplicating an existing entry.

   For Codex:

   codex mcp add iris -- iris mcp
   codex mcp get iris

   For another MCP client, configure command `iris` with args `["mcp"]`.
4. Prove the CLI works:

   iris https://example.com --selector h1 --padding 8 --scale 1 --json \
     -o /tmp/iris-smoke.png

   Confirm `status: ok` and a readable, non-empty PNG.
5. Reload the MCP configuration or start a fresh agent task if required. Call
   Iris's `capture` tool once for `https://example.com`, selecting the first
   `h1` with 8px padding and scale 1. Confirm an inline PNG and structured
   dimensions are returned.
6. Report the installed Iris version, MCP configuration, CLI smoke result, MCP
   smoke result, and any remaining blocker.

Do not claim MCP success from the CLI test alone. Do not add browser automation,
interaction scripting, or review tooling; use Iris only as the camera.
```

## What it does for you

- Renders with your real installed Chrome, driven over the DevTools Protocol
- Waits for fonts, image loads, and finite entrance animations under one shared three-second budget. Rendered-frame waits and full-page scrolling also count toward the capture timeout.
- Captures the first matching element with `--selector`, automatically scrolling it into view and settling newly visible content before framing it
- Serves the same capture engine to coding agents with `iris mcp`, returning pixels inline instead of making the agent locate a file
- Retina `@2x` output by default; full pages taller than Chrome's ~16k px render limit fall back to `@1x` automatically (the report tells you which you got); `--max-pixels` lowers output density without resizing the page
- Image format from the `-o` extension or `--format`: `png` (default), `jpg`, `webp`; `--quality` controls JPEG/WebP encoding (0–100, default 90)
- One browser process, concurrent headless windows; a failed URL prints `✗` and never kills the batch (exit code 1 if anything failed)
- Batch filenames derive from the URL (`example.com-pricing.png`); collisions get `-2`, `-3` suffixes
- `--json` writes one JSON object per completed capture to stdout, in concurrent completion order; capture failures are JSON too and still produce exit code 1

Element capture is intentionally CSS-selector based: Iris captures the first match in document order. `--selector` conflicts with `--full`; `--padding` requires it. Cross-origin iframe contents and capturing every match are not supported.

```json
{"status":"ok","url":"https://example.com/","output":"/absolute/example.com.png","mode":"element","selector":"h1","padding":24,"css_width":180,"css_height":72,"scale":2.0,"format":"png","bytes":14231,"page":{"final_url":"https://example.com/","title":"Example","document_width":1440,"document_height":900,"pending_images":0,"failed_images":0,"fonts_pending":false,"running_animations":0},"timings":{"setup_ms":20,"navigation_ms":35,"ready_ms":100,"screenshot_ms":30,"total_ms":185},"warnings":[]}
```

## Benchmarking

Capture time includes navigation and Iris's correctness waits, so compare the same URL, capture mode, viewport, scale, Chrome version, and hardware. Prefer a deterministic local page when comparing releases; public URLs add network and server variance.

For a repeatable one-shot CLI benchmark from this repository, install [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) and run:

```sh
cargo build --release
hyperfine --warmup 1 --runs 10 \
  './target/release/iris file://$PWD/tests/fixtures/precise-capture.html \
    --selector .capture-target --padding 24 --scale 1 \
    -o /tmp/iris-benchmark.png'
```

The CLI starts a Chrome process for every invocation. MCP keeps one Chrome process alive for the server's lifetime, so benchmark it separately: initialize once, record the first `capture`, then report the median and p95 of at least ten identical subsequent calls. Measure from JSON-RPC request to complete tool response and exclude model time.

Reference results (not a performance guarantee):

| Iris | Machine | Chrome | Workload | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.4.1 | Apple M2 Max, macOS 26.5.2 | 151.0.7922.138 | One-shot CLI, 10 runs after one warmup | 1.00 s median |
| 0.4.1 | Apple M2 Max, macOS 26.5.2 | 151.0.7922.138 | MCP first capture | 965 ms |
| 0.4.1 | Apple M2 Max, macOS 26.5.2 | 151.0.7922.138 | MCP next 10 captures | 366 ms median, 383 ms p95 |

All reference runs used the local `precise-capture.html` fixture, `.capture-target`, 24px padding, PNG, and scale 1. Record `iris --version`, the Chrome version, and the exact command with any published result.

A separate before/after comparison used a GitHub-hosted ARM64 runner with macOS 26.6.2 and Chrome 152.0.7977.83. The baseline was upstream `main` at `227d3109`; the candidate adds the capture controls and agent workflows below.

| MCP capture time | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Warm median, 20 captures per version | 1,057 ms | 611 ms |
| Warm p95, nearest rank | 1,261 ms | 708 ms |
| First capture, two fresh servers per version | 5,694 / 2,097 ms | 2,489 / 2,199 ms |

The run order was baseline, candidate, candidate, baseline. Each server captured the same local fixture once, then ten more times: `.capture-target`, 10px padding, a 320×240 viewport, PNG, scale 1, and a 30-second timeout. Every image decoded to 141×81 pixels.

The warm median fell by 42%. First-capture times varied and do not establish a reliable startup improvement.

[Raw timing samples](.github/capture-benchmark.json) retain the run order and capture settings. The linked workflow contains the command receipts.

## Flags

```
-o, --out <PATH>       output file (single URL) or directory (batch)
-s, --size <SIZE>      WxH, or desktop (1440x900@2x) | iphone (390x844@3x) | ipad (1024x1366@2x)
    --full             capture the full page height
    --selector <CSS>   capture the first element matching a CSS selector
    --padding <PX>     nonnegative CSS-pixel padding around a selected element
    --dark             emulate prefers-color-scheme: dark
    --format <FMT>     png | jpg | webp (a recognized --out extension wins)
    --quality <N>      JPEG/WebP quality, 0–100 (default: 90)
    --max-pixels <N>   cap output pixels by lowering density, not resizing the page
    --freeze-animations finish finite animations and pause repeating ones
    --wait <MS>        extra delay before the final readiness check
    --wait-for <CSS>   wait until a selector exists before capturing
    --scale <N>        device scale factor (overrides the preset's)
    --jobs <N>         concurrent captures (default: min(4, URLs))
    --timeout <SECS>   capture budget (default: 30; MCP includes queue and browser startup)
    --chrome <PATH>    browser binary (auto-detected; also via $CHROME)
    --json             emit one JSON object per completed capture
```

Capture reports include the final URL, title, document dimensions, pending or failed images, font readiness, active animations, stage timings, and warnings.

A completed image is not proof that every page asset loaded. An explicit `wait_for` or `wait_ms` can help with app-specific readiness.

Timings cover the active capture. MCP queueing and cold browser startup are outside `timings.total_ms`, but inside `timeout_seconds`.

Cancelling an MCP request stops queued work and in-progress captures. Comparisons check for cancellation between decoding steps and rows. A file write that has already started may finish.

`freeze_animations` changes the state being photographed: finite animations finish and repeating animations pause. Use it for stable layout inspection, not for checking motion. Canvas, video, and JavaScript timers are not frozen.

A pixel budget too small to retain at least one pixel on each axis returns an error.

## Compare saved captures

`iris compare before.png after.png --threshold 8 -o diff.png` prints a JSON report. A pixel changes when its largest channel difference exceeds the threshold. Transparent pixels are composited on white.

Different dimensions are compared on the union canvas without rescaling. Pixels present in only one image count as changed. The optional PNG marks changed pixels red.

Comparison errors exit nonzero. A nonzero change count is a result, not a command failure.
